# Frontend-Mentor-Easybank-landing-page
I have completed my first responsive landing page using HTML, CSS (SCSS) and JS in one week. I used many online resources such us youtube tutorials (super helpful lady - Coder Coder), css-tricks.com, codepen.io and a "HTML&amp;CSS"/"JavaScript&amp;JQuery" textbooks by Jon Duckett to finish this challenge.
